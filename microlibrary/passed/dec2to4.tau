# 2-to-4 Decoder
#
# Defines a 2-to-4 decoder. This is a combinational component.
#
# Interface:
#   a, b:    2-bit address input.
#   x,y,z,v: 4-bit data output.
#
# Logic:
# The output line corresponding to the binary value of the address (ab) is high.
# x is high for address 00.
# y is high for address 01.
# z is high for address 10.
# v is high for address 11.

dec2to4(a, b, x,y,z,v) := (
  (x = (a' & b')) &&
  (y = (a' & b))  &&
  (z = (a & b'))  &&
  (v = (a & b))
)
