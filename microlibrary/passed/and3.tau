# microlibrary/pending/and3.tau
#
# Defines a 3-input AND gate, both structurally and behaviorally.
# This is a minimal test case to debug compositional proof failures.

# --- Behavioral Definition ---
and3_b(a,b,c,o) := (o = a & b & c).

# --- Structural Definition ---
# Built from two 2-input AND gates.
and3_s(a,b,c,o) := ex w (and2(a,b,w) && and2(w,c,o)).
