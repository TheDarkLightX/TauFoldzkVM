# 1-Bit Register (D-Latch)
#
# Defines a single 1-bit register using the canonical Tau syntax for stateful elements.
# This is the fundamental building block for the structural RAM model.
#
# Inputs:
#   i[t]:  The 1-bit data input at time t.
#   we[t]: The write-enable signal at time t. 
#
# Outputs:
#   o[t]: The 1-bit data output at time t. Reflects the state from the previous cycle.

reg1(i, we, o) := always (
    o[t] <-> (we[t-1] & i[t-1]) | (we[t-1]' & o[t-1])
).
